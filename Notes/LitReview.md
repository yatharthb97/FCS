## Introduction

Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy is used to measure directly the average number of particles in the observation volume, and the diffusion time of those particles. From these direct measurements, using specific models, the concentration of the particles and their sizes can be determined.



The sensitivity of the experiment depends on the averages number of particles in the observation volume. Too many particles result in flattening of the signal, whereas for very low concentrations, the environment noise dominates the time series signal.

A generic FCS setups usually use nano-molar or sometimes pico-molar  concentrations. The observation volume is in the order of $~1 \space fL$ and < 100 particles are present within the observation volume.



The time  vs Intensity signal or time series is used to generate an Autocorrelation function, which can be used extract system phenomena based on various models that take it as an input.
